# node.js meme scraper

Create a cli (Command Line Interface) application that scrapes the **current version** of this website:

https://memegen-link-examples-upleveled.netlify.app/

...and saves the first 10 images into a folder called "memes" within the directory of the new project. The image files should be named with a number with a leading zero, eg. `01.jpg`, `02.jpg`, etc.

Avoid using an "image scraper" or "image downloader" library that does multiple steps at once for you (eg. do not use [`image-downloader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/image-downloader) or [`nodejs-file-downloader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodejs-file-downloader) or similar) - break the task down into smaller steps and select libraries as necessary for each step.

Make sure that the meme images are "ignored" in Git - they should not show up in your repository.

The program should be able to run multiple times without throwing an error.

## stretch goal #1:

- Make the application create your own custom meme (eg. `node index.js hello karl bender` would download an image with the top text of "hello", the bottom text of "karl", with the meme image of Bender)

**bender.js** adds the costum bender meme into the .memes file with the title "bender.jpg"
